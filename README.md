# Bloggo

This may become a blogging engine. Currently it is just a basic ClojureScript
frontend app, with the point of learning and trying out shadow-cljs.

## Development

* Install shadow-cljs from npm: `npm install -g shadow-cljs`
* Install npm dependencies with `npm i`
* Start shadow-cljs build watch `npm start`
* Run tests with `npm test` or in the browser continuously with `npm test-watch`
* Start serverless back end emulation with `serverless offline`

## Release

* Build a release build by running `./build.sh`
